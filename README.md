adding images was a lot easier than drawing a sketch with shapes as I really struggle with visualising the positioning for things on the canvas without a grid layout. above I have an image of a 3d mesh and the second image being with the grey filter applied, then altering the pixels to be red.

I decided to use this old film image I had on my laptop to create a new image using the random function as this image had more colours to work with and generate something more interesting.

I then added more images to the file and let the random function continue to produce random colours amongst the other images. I changes the shape to rectangle just to make it more clear.
